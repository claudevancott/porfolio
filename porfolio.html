      <p class="intro">  Hello. I'm douglas. I went to USF for undergrad. I believe that science is like candy: its good whether its "hard" or "soft". I've worked in catering and restaurants for about a decade. Even in the context of my part-time jobs I've found myself spotting and relating systems, amid the romance of food and people. I'm looking forward to mastering the art and science of web development while meeting new people. I currently live in Atlanta, Georgia :

        <p>Doing things by the book is great, but nothing teaches you about improvisation and "dancing in the flames" like cooking.</p>

        <p>I usually stick to non-fiction, but I jive with a bit of flourish and fantasy too. I like reading books I wouldn't normally read to cherry pick fun facts, adopt styles, and prompt inspiration. </p>
